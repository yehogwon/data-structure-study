We learn what queues are and how to implement them with array/linked list. Also, we study the advnatages / disadvantages of using linked list as a queue. The queue we implement at the beginning of this chapter is used as a simulation backbone. As an advanced topic, we learn what a deque is and how to implement it with doubly linked list.
