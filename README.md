# A repository for learning data structures in C/C++

## Overview

Let's learn data structures with Yoon's book. 

>This book implements data structures in C, so I just learn the notion and how-it-works of data structures from the book. After that, I will implement data structures in C++. 

## How To Build

This repository adopts CMake to generate Unix Makefile. So, you can build this project as follows: 

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## How To Test

*This repository does not offer test code yet. The template of test code will be added soon.*

**I'm waiting for your PRs for test cases 😁**
