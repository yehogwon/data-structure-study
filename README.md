# A repository for learning data structures in C/C++

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/yehogwon/data-structure-study/actions/workflows/cmake-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yehogwon/data-structure-study/actions/workflows/cmake-ci.yml)

## Overview

Let's learn data structures with Yoon's book. 

>This book implements data structures in C, so I just learn the notion and how-it-works of data structures from the book. After that, I will implement data structures in C++. 

### Chapter

1. Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures
2. Recursion
3. Linked List I
4. Linked List II
5. Linked List III
6. Stack
7. Queue
8. Tree
9. Priority Queue and Heap
10. Sorting
11. Search I
12. Search II
13. Table and Hash
14. Graph
