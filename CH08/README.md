# CH08. Tree

In chapter 8, we learn a nonlinear data structure, namely a **tree**, for the first time. Specifically, we learn the general structure of trees and focus on binary trees. We also discuss ways to traverse along the nodes in a tree and implement a binary tree using linked list. Using what we implement, we do an application on calculator. That is, we implement an expression tree and use it to evaluate an expression.
